# ECE287 Simon Says Game README

This project is for my ECE 287 class final project where we had to design something on our own 
or in groups to present as a final project to show our understanding throughout the semester in the course. 
I chose to do this project alone and created a Simon Says game on the De2-115 board that can be used with a 
VGA display connected to a monitor for the game.
